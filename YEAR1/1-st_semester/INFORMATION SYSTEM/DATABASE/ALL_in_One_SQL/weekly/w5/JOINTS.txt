SQL JOINS :-

1. Inner join:-
-- it is that kind of join  in where we can join only commo value of two tables.

query;-
 
   SELECT * FROM table_1, table_2 
   WHERE table_1.columnName = table_2.columnName;
  (note: we cant get get non comman value)

proper query for it :-
 -- SELECT * FROM table_1
    JOIN table_2
    ON table_1.columnName = table_2.columnName;

if we want to fetch some special column of both table we all have to need is JOIN for eg:-


SELECT table_1.columnName, name, price
FROM customers,
JOIN table_2,
ON table_1.columnName = table_2.columnName;

(note: columnName are primary key obtain column which is also must be the FK of anouther table) 



2. LEFT join:-
-- left join is that kind of joints in where we can fetch common value of common column of both table but also we will fetch all the uncommon value of the left table:-

query;-
SELECT column_name 
FROM table_1 
LEFT JOIN table_2
ON table_1.columnName = table_2.columnName;


3. RIGHT join:-
-- right join is that kind of joints in where we can fetch common value of common column of both table but also we will fetch all the uncommon value of the right table:-

query;-
SELECT column_name 
FROM table_2 
RIGHT JOIN table_1
ON table_2.columnName = table_1.columnName;
